## PROJECT 5: Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston

> ### TASK: Study linear regression with Pytorch
> 

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

- Studying **Linear Regression with Pytorch**

#### Project objectives

1. Explore and prepare data 
2. Build linear regression model


### Dataset

[Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

Uber vs Lyft

This is a very beginner-friendly dataset. It does contain a lot of NA values. It is a good dataset if you want to use a Linear Regression Model to see the pattern between different predectors such as hour and price.

A really amazing part of this dataset is that I have included the corresponding weather data for that hour with a short summary of the weather. Other important factors are temperature, wind, and sunset.


### Results

1. [ ] [**Linear Regression Model**]()
